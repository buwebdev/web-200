## Course Description

This course examines the fundamentals specific to web development. Topics will include web standards, accessibility/usability, and the coding languages which serve as the foundation for web development: HTML and CSS. 
Students work with these languages at a basic level, learning the essential structures, coding conventions, and best practices associated with the effective use of HTML and CSS in modern web-development environments. 

Prerequisite: Basic computer literacy

## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code, so you can visually see the concept "in action." Assignments are organized by "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
