## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code, so you can visually see the concept "in action." Assignments are organized by "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
